RLE Parse Object

1. Header: provides height and weight of pattern
    x = m, y = n
      - m is the height
      - n is the weight
- sometimes the header includes rule = ___ following previous statement

2. Pattern encoded as <run_count><tag>
    <run_count> is the number of occurences of <tag>
       - if <run_count> = 1, it can be omitted
    <tag> is either b, o, $
       - b = dead cell, o = live cell, $ = end of line
- organized by ROW order, left to right


- the last <run_count><tag> item is followed by an ! to signal the end of the pattern
- dead cells at the end are not encoded, so we can assume all cells after the ! are dead

Types of lines that precede the header:
  - #C or #c = comment
  - #N = pattern name
  - #O = says author and date of file creation
  - #P or #R = coordinates of top-left corner of pattern (usually negative, left of origin)
  - #r = rules for the pattern

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Example: Glider RLE format
    #C This is a glider.           - * -
    x = 3, y = 3                   - - *
    bo$2bo$3o!                     * * *

This means:
- Column 1:
    b - 1 dead cell
    o - 1 live cell
- Column 2:
    2b - 2 dead cells
    o - 1 live cell
- Column 3:
    3o - 3 live cells
